			Our service works the best with Facebook log in. We use Facebook data to be able to show you information about your friends’ subjects.  And if you have added data (by adding subjects as done/doing/etc) your friends will also be able to see that.
			We plan to also add features which display your name and facebook link (you will be able to opt out) to other students viewing subjects that you have added.
			We also plan to add features which allow conversations about subjects, which you will be able to post and interact with. We will display your name and facebook link (exactly the same as other websites) 
			We will never do bad things with your data. We won’t sell it or use it for evil. We promise to use it only in the best interest of building Mubook to be the most useful tool for you, the students.
